### 2. Quick Start Guide

1.  **Add the `TooltipTrigger` Component:**
    Select any UI GameObject and add the `TooltipTrigger` component.

    Fill in the fields in the Inspector.

**Done!** The `TooltipManager` is created automatically. See the Demo Scene in `Assets/Easy Tooltip/Demo` for live examples.

---

### 3. Core Components

*   **`TooltipTrigger`:** The main component you add to your UI elements.
*   **`TooltipManager`:** The "brain" of the system. It is created automatically.
*   **`Tooltip`:** The visual prefab for the tooltip. You can edit it to change the default fonts, background, etc. It is located in `Assets/Easy Tooltip/Prefabs/`.

---

### 4. Configuration

You can configure global settings (Max Width, Fade Speed, etc.) in two ways:

**1. Global Settings (Recommended):**
Edit the **`TooltipManager` prefab** directly. This changes the defaults for your whole project.
Prefab Path: `Assets/Easy Tooltip/Resources/TooltipManager.prefab`

**2. Per-Scene Overrides (Optional):**
Drag the `TooltipManager` prefab into a scene's hierarchy to use different settings for that scene only.

### 5. FAQ & Support

**Q: My tooltip is appearing behind my other UI! How do I fix it?**
A: This happens because of Unity's UI rendering order. The system automatically tries to place the tooltip on top, but here are the definitive solutions for complex cases:

*   **Multiple Canvases:** If you use more than one Canvas, ensure the Canvas containing the tooltip has a higher "Sort Order" in its Inspector.

*   **Dynamically Created UI:** If you create new UI elements at runtime *after* the tooltip has appeared, they may draw on top of it.

*   **The Best Practice:** To guarantee the tooltip is *always* on top, the recommended professional solution is to place it on its own dedicated Canvas. Create a new Canvas, set its "Sort Order" to a high number (e.g., 999), and place the `TooltipManager` inside it. This will solve all layering issues.
